# Strawberry
Strawberry, a simple, staticly typed programming language
# Goals
Strawberry is a programming language that is going to be made for game dev,
but i am still in the process of making it, so this is my roadmap:
- basic types ( missing: Boolean and Float, implemented: Int, String )
- logic statements
- logical operators
- basic C-like math expressions
- for and while loops
- functions
- arrays
- structures ( like in C )
- include files

then making a good bytecode for it to run, also implement all those juicy things, engines like unity have
- Sprites
- Scene Management
- Debuging
- Text Rendering
- Sound Engine
and that should be most of the things i want to implement in this project.

# Contribution
for now, i want to make all this alone, but when i end the phase 1 ( making a working programming language )
i think i will accept contribution from others to the repo :)
