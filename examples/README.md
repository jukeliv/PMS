# Hello coder
hi!!! if you are checking this, it means that you want to learn more about the lang,
THATS GREAT!!! but maybe not everything here makes cense to you, that is cuz
most of this things are tests to check if i haven't break any functionality while adding something new
but in the future when the language is more complete this will not be an issue, trust me... ALSO!!!

# TODO
move all this tests into there own "test" folder
